# Rosbakh, Pichler, and Poschlod, Machine learning algorithms predict soil seed bank persistence from easily available traits

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in Rosbakh et
al., Machine learning algorithms predict soil seed bank persistence from
easily available traits.

## Data

## Methods

Data preparation, the ML pipeline for SSB density and PA can be found in
the [‘1_ML Analysis.Rmd’]('1_ML%20Analysis.Rmd) script. The
[‘2_Figures.Rmd’]('2_Figures.Rmd) script can be used to create the
figures.

## Results

Figures can be found as pdf images in the Figures/ subfolder.
