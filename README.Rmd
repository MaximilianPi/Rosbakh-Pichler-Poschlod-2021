# Rosbakh, Pichler, and Poschlod, Machine learning algorithms predict soil seed bank persistence from easily available traits

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in Rosbakh et al., Machine learning algorithms predict soil seed bank persistence from easily available traits.

## Data
Data for this study can be found in the 'Data' subfolder.

## Methods

Data preparation, the ML pipeline for SSB density and PA can be found in the ['1_ML Analysis.Rmd']('1_ML Analysis.Rmd) script. 
The ['2_Figures.Rmd']('2_Figures.Rmd) script can be used to create the figures.

## Results
Figures can be found as pdf images in the Figures/ subfolder.
